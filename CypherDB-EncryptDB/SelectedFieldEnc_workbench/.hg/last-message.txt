Modifiy each *_sqlite.c file to add an array indicating the encrypted fields.
Also, getPageData function can now change the header of the payload
type = 10 --> encrypted integer of 4 bytes size
type = 11 --> encrypted real of 8 bytes size
Currently, only OPE items are unencrypted. Other fields are all encrypted.
