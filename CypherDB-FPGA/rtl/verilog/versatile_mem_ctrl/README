			Versatile memory controller RTL

Project URL: http://opencores.org/project,versatile_mem_ctrl

Currently this is only configured and used as an SDRAM controller.

Configure SDRAM part size:

Uncomment one of the following defines in rtl/verilog/sdr_16_defines.v:

`define MT48LC32M16   // 64MB part
`define MT48LC16M16   // 32MB part
`define MT48LC4M16    //  8MB part

This will enable the appropriate column and row bank sizes.

When one of these defines is changed, running "make all" in this path will
regenerate it. Be warned that several tools and scripts are required to
regenerate the memory controller module.

Tools required to re-generate memory controller:

subversion:
	Presumably this is already installed.

excel2csv:

CentOS/RedHat:

     I ran into some problems just trying to update Perl, and it turns out the 
     ftp download program Perl uses is called 'ncftpget' which isn't on CentOS 
     by default.

     I followed this guide, 
     http://www.question-defense.com/2010/01/25/install-ncftp-ncftpget-ncftpput-using-yum-on-centos-linux-server 
     to install it with the following commands:

     $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

     $ yum list *NCFTP*

     $ sudo yum install ncftp

Ubuntu:

     Under Ubuntu these packages are availble (if not already installed) in the
     ncftp package in apt, installable with the following command:

     $ sudo apt-get install ncftp


Configure Perl's CPAN:

     First tried to configure CPAN according to this: 
     http://www.d3dw8.com/code/configuring_cpan.html


     Then I launched CPAN and updated it (following that first guide):

     $ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shel

     cpan> o conf prerequisites_policy ask

     cpan> o conf make_install_arg   UNINST=1

     cpan> o conf commit

     cpan> quit

     $ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell

     cpan> o conf init

     This will then spit out a bunch of questions - just press enter for them 
     all (defaults are fine), but make sure no other programs are missing (it 
     starts asking for gzip, tar, etc. this is when I spotted ncftpget was 
     missing.)

     (Sweden is country 28 when it asks, and then I put just '1' when it asked 
     me to select the mirror URLs).

     cpan> quit

     Finally, we can update CPAN:

     $ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell

     cpan> install Bundle::CPAN

     <lots of stuff>

     It then paused near this message:

     ERRORS/WARNINGS FOUND IN PREREQUISITES.  You may wish to install the 
     versions of the modules indicated above before proceeding with this 
     installation

       Shall I follow them and prepend them to the queue
       of modules we are processing right now? [yes]

     ... and I pressed enter (for yes.)

     It then did it again, and I pressed enter for yes, again...

     ... and another yes ...

     ... and then something asking if we should exit a test (i just pressed 
     enter) ...

     (man this is taking forever)

     ... finally back to the cpan> prompt...

     To install the prerequisities for the excel2csv package I did the 
     following:

     cpan> install Getopt::Long

     cpan> install Pod::Usage

     cpan> install Spreadsheet::ParseExcel

     ... this needed to install some other prerequisites ....

     cpan> quit

     CPAN mess finished!

Now we can finally install excel2csv:

    $ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/L/LE/LEOCHARRE/excel2csv-1.01.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf excel2csv-1.01.tar.gz 
    $ cd excel2csv-1.01
    excel2csv-1.01$ perl Makefile.PL
    excel2csv-1.01$ make
    excel2csv-1.01$ sudo make install

PHP CLI:

    Some other part of the makefile requires the PHP command line interface 
    (CLI) be installed.

    On a 64-bit CentOS/RedHad this was done with:

    $ sudo yum install php-cli.x86_64

    On Ubuntu 9.10 this was done with:

    $ sudo apt-get install php5-cli

Perl-Verilog:

    This Perl Verilog HDL preprocessor tool is required, also.

    On a 64-bit CentOS/RedHad this was done with:

    $ sudo yum install perl-Verilog-Perl.x86_64

    On Ubuntu 9.10 this was done with:

    $ sudo apt-get install libverilog-perl


Once these tools are installed the versatile memory controller project can
be compiled.

The makefile and scripts here usually perform an automatic checkout and compile 
of the design, however there have been modifications to the project's 
(versatile_mem_ctrl) RTL that are yet to be re-contributed to the design, and 
so we will disable automatic-checking out and building for now.
